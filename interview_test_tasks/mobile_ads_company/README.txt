Task was very interesting for me. Probably one of the coolest tests in
my lifetime :).

Here is my solution (files):

  - all code is in 'circuit.py' (executable, runs 6 test inputs, 0.5 seconds
                               on my average Core-i5 laptop)
  - '??[0-3].txt' - my own test inputs (small, 16 lines, same circuit,
                                      please refer to 'my_test.txt')
  - 'bigt[1-2].txt' - inputs from AoC site.
  - 'my_test.txt' - visualization of my test circuit and some debug info.
  - 'git.log' - git log of my progress (few days couple of hours in each).


No matter what you will decide in my case, the task was COOL.
Thanks for introducing AoC site to me! Take a look at http://checkio.org
This is quite the same but with nice graphical visualizations.


Have a great day,
